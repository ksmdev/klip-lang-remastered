# Klip Language

Klip is a new front end programming language built upon swift

## Installation

Make sure you have the xcode-select tools installed then to compile the klip binary run

```bash
swiftc -o klip klipcore.swift
```

## Usage

In the directory you klip binary was created in run

```bash
./klip filename.klip
```

IMPORTANT: filename needs to be replaced with your actually file name!

## File Template
```dart
print("Welcome to Klip Lang!")
print("Made By: Kyle Mendell")
String myText = "I Love This"

myText = "this is my new text"

Int myInt = 10

log("this will be logged to log.txt")
log("im loving klip lang")
```

Everything you see in the file above is included in klip this file will be updated when new features are added. If you try to write different code then whats above you will break the binary!
